Subsequential Time Series Clustering: Evidence of Temporal Patterns in Exchange Rate
====================================================================================

This is the official repository of the research poster **Clustering Subsecuencial de Series de Tiempo: Evidencia de Patrones Temporales en el tipo de cambio USD/MXN**, originally presented in its spanish version at the National Seminar *Escuela de Probabilidad y Estad√≠stica 2020* (`EPE2020`_). Its an academic event organized by `CIMAT`_ (A government-funded research institute, internationally renowned, which main focus is Mathematical Research).

General Elements of the Project
-------------------------------

There are three types of content in this repository.

1. Data scraping, preparation and clustering: **Python**
2. Data analysis, synthesis and presentation: **R**
3. Tables, Figures, Formulas within the beamer poster: **LaTeX**

Project Execution
-----------------

In order to conduct a wide list of experiments variations with all *candidate trigger events* searching within all the historical prices, it was necessary to perform a parallelization of the project, mainly in the process where the *MASS* algorithm was used to search for subsequential patterns. 

MASS Algorithm
--------------

This work was aimed at testing the capabilities of the *Mueen's Algorithm for Similarity Search* (`MASS`_), we acknowledge the work of the original authors which can be consulted for further technical details.

mass-ts
-------

The python implementation that was utilized for this work is the `MASS-TS`_ python package, which can be found and installed at https://pypi.org/project/mass-ts/
