# Create 3 randomly selected groups of at least 20 data for each sceario of each indicator
# Calculate 4 different price metrics to search for invariance in price reactions due to
# the release of the economic indicator

# analysis of unequal sample size condition for ANOVA test for mean invariance between groups

# Test for invariance in 3 price metrics for each indicator, to look for homogeinity in price
# response as a potential condition to a pattern presence due to the release of the economic
# indicator

# subset the EI list with the ones that show invariance in the mean response for the metrics
